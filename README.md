Fashion Preference Chatbot
Overview
Fashion Preference Chatbot is a smart chatbot designed to simplify the shopping experience by providing personalized outfit recommendations based on user preferences. Unlike traditional e-commerce websites that offer a plethora of options through filters, our chatbot predefines the user's taste by asking essential questions, thus minimizing confusion and saving time.

How It Works
The chatbot operates on a question-and-answer basis to determine the user's taste. It asks questions regarding the user's skin tone, personal style, preferred colors, and type of outfits they like. Based on these inputs, it recommends outfits tailored to the user's preferences.

Example Use Case
If a user wants to shop for an outfit for Diwali, they can simply inform the chatbot. The chatbot will then display recommendations based on the user's past preferences.

Features
Skin Tone and Color Pairing
Our project includes a skin tone and color pairing feature. This helps in determining the user's skin tone and suggests colors that best suit them. For example, in offline stores, customers can physically see and choose the right product. However, online, selecting a color like red can sometimes be hit or miss. To address this, we use skin tone prediction.

Skin Tone Prediction
The chatbot can display skin tone cards to help users select their skin tone. If the user is unsure of their skin tone, they can enable the camera. The screen will split into two parts: one part for the camera and the other part for skin card sliding. This allows the user to compare their skin tone with the cards.

Disclaimer: This feature depends on the camera resolution.

By incorporating these functionalities, the chatbot helps predict the best outfit for the user in minimal time.
